      <p>
        My approach to teaching is grounded in social justice, cultural humility, and critical reflection. As someone whose academic journey has traversed globally, I bring a transnational and interdisciplinary perspective into the classroom, shaped by my lived experience as a first-generation college student, a member of the LGBTQ community, and an Asian immigrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        I view teaching as a collaborative and emancipatory practice, one that equips students with the tools to interrogate systems of oppression and engage in transformative social work. My pedagogy is anchored in three core commitments:
      </p>
      <ul style="line-height: 1.85; font-size: 15.5px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <li><strong>Contextualized and experiential learning:</strong> I create opportunities for students to engage with real-world issues through case-based instruction, community narratives, policy simulations, and participatory activities. Drawing from my research on migration, policy, and health, I encourage students to connect theory with practice across global and local contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility and inclusive dialogue:</strong> I strive to cultivate a learning space where students of all backgrounds feel heard, supported, and empowered. I employ flexible teaching formats, multi-modal assignments, and anonymous feedback to accommodate diverse learning needs. I also share my positionality with students to foster mutual trust and critical awareness of power and privilege.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical and interdisciplinary integration:</strong> I integrate perspectives from public health, policy studies, migration research, and data science to expand how students understand structural inequalities. Whether teaching research methods or social welfare, I introduce students to both quantitative rigor and critical frameworks, emphasizing questions of representation, ethics, and systemic impact.</li>
      </ul>
